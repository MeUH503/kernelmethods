    "# Demo of kernel methods library\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we present the various important components of the `kernelmethods` library, and provide some example usage scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "This library consists of a set of key classes such as `KernelMatrix`, a diverse library of kernel functions, as well as meta classes like `KernelSet` and `KernelBucket` to manage an array of kernel matrices. In addition, a library of kernel operations and related utilities are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kernel functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with some **kernel functions**!\n",
    "\n",
    "A [kernel function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_kernel) takes in two samples (each represented by an array of values in their raw input space) as inputs and computes their inner product. In a typical machine learning library, these kernel functions are usually directly implemented as mathematical formulas, that blindly compute and return the inner product. They are almost always without any structure, validation or representation associated with them, which can be a recipe for invalid or disastrous implementations. In this library, given kernel functions are key to and at the core of everything, we take a more concerted effort to enforce certain structure, uniform validation and readable representation. We achieve this by defining a `BaseKernelFunction` abstract base class and making each kernel function inherit from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BaseKernelFunction` enforces each derived kernel:\n",
    "1. to be callable, with two inputs\n",
    "2. to have a name and a str representation\n",
    "3. provides a method to check whether the derived kernel func is a valid kernel i.e. the kernel matrix derived on a random sample is positive semi-definite (PSD)\n",
    "4. and that it is symmetric (via tests) as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties can be verified using the built-in kernel functions such as `PolyKernel` and `GaussianKernel` e.g. "
